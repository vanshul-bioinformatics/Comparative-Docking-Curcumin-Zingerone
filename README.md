# Comparative Docking Study of Curcumin and Zingerone

## Overview
This repository contains molecular docking and ADMET analysis data for curcumin and zingerone against DNA gyrase and beta-lactamase. The study was performed as part of an MSc research project using computational approaches.

## Objective
To compare the binding affinity and pharmacokinetic properties of curcumin and zingerone against DNA gyrase and beta-lactamase.

## Tools Used
- SwissDock (molecular docking)
- PyMOL (visualization)
- SwissADME (ADMET prediction)

## Workflow
1. Protein structures retrieved from the Protein Data Bank
2. Ligand preparation and optimization
3. Molecular docking using SwissDock
4. Visualization of docked complexes using PyMOL
5. ADME and ADMET analysis using SwissADME

## Results Summary
Curcumin showed stronger binding affinity towards both target enzymes, while zingerone demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic properties.
